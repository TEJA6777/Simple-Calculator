# 🧮 Simple Calculator (Python + Tkinter)

My first repository — a simple calculator written in Python using the Tkinter GUI library.  
This is a basic **GUI calculator application** built using **Python's Tkinter** library. It supports standard arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division — all within a simple and intuitive interface.
